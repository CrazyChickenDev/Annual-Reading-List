Articles
========
 * [Your lifestyle has already been designed - David Cain](http://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/)

> "But the 8-hour workday is too profitable for big business, not because of the amount of work people get done in eight hours (the average office worker gets less than three hours of actual work done in 8 hours) but because it makes for such a purchase-happy public. Keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience, gratification, and any other relief they can buy. It keeps them watching television, and its commercials. It keeps them unambitious outside of work."

* [Showdown at the airport body scanner - Nathaniel Rich](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/25/showdown-at-the-airport-body-scanner/)

> "I am offered the option of enduring my rubdown in private. I always refuse: Civil disobedience is worth nothing if it’s not done in public."
...
> "Airplane travel is disquieting, as is dealing with peevish federal officers, as is life. Even the slightest gesture of assertiveness can create the pleasing illusion that you control your fate."

* [I do not fear death - Roger Ebert](http://www.salon.com/2011/09/15/roger_ebert/)

> "'Kindness' covers all of my political beliefs. No need to spell them out. I believe that if, at the end, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try. I didn’t always know this and am happy I lived long enough to find it out."
