Annual Reading List
===================

This is a list of books or articles that I plan to read every year. It will be revolving, meaning titles will be switched out as they become stale to me. I plan to have about 5-10 total items on this list at a time, with an archive of previously listed works.

Books
=====
* [Anything You Want - Derek Sivers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11878168-anything-you-want)


Articles
========
* [Masters of Love - Emily Esfahani Smith](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/happily-ever-after/372573/)

Why?

### "As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives.""

### - Henry David Thoreau

I feel like a lot of people read important ideas once and never get the chance to implement them.
The purpose of this list is that ideas that are important to me get the chance to take hold
in my mind. By reading these works annually, I will be introduced to these ideas again
and again until they become habitual to me.
