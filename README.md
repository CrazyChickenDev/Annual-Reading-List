Articles
========
- [x] [Your lifestyle has already been designed - David Cain](http://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/)

> "But the 8-hour workday is too profitable for big business, not because of the amount of work people get done in eight hours (the average office worker gets less than three hours of actual work done in 8 hours) but because it makes for such a purchase-happy public. Keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience, gratification, and any other relief they can buy. It keeps them watching television, and its commercials. It keeps them unambitious outside of work."

- [ ] [Masters of love - Emily Esfahani Smith](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/happily-ever-after/372573/)
- [ ] [The slow death of purposeless walking - Finlo Rohrer](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27186709)
- [x] [You Are Free, Like it or Not - David Cain](http://www.raptitude.com/2015/06/you-are-free-like-it-or-not/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Raptitudecom+%28Raptitude.com%29)

> "In every instant, we are free to behave however we like, but we often act as though circumstances have reduced our options down to one or two ways to move forward. 

This is bad faith: when we convince ourselves that we’re less free than we really are, so that we don’t have to feel responsible for what we ultimately make of ourselves. It really seems like you must get up at 7:00 every Monday, because constraints such as your job, your family’s schedule, and your body’s needs leave no other possibility. But it’s not true — you can set your alarm for any time, and are free to explore what’s different about life when you do."

- [ ] [I do not fear death - Roger Ebert](http://www.salon.com/2011/09/15/roger_ebert/)
- [x] [Showdown at the airport body scanner - Nathaniel Rich](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/25/showdown-at-the-airport-body-scanner/?_r=0)

> "I am offered the option of enduring my rubdown in private. I always refuse: Civil disobedience is worth nothing if it’s not done in public." ...
> "Airplane travel is disquieting, as is dealing with peevish federal officers, as is life. Even the slightest gesture of assertiveness can create the pleasing illusion that you control your fate."

Why?
====

> "As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives." - Henry David Thoreau

I feel like a lot of people read important ideas once and never get the chance to implement them.
The purpose of this list is that ideas that are important to me get the chance to take hold
in my mind. By reading these works annually, I will be introduced to these ideas again
and again until they become habitual to me.
