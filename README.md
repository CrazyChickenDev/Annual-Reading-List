Annual Reading List
===================

This is a list of books or articles that I plan to read every year. It will be revolving, meaning titles will be switched out as they become stale to me. I plan to have about 5-10 total items on this list at a time, with an archive of previously listed works.

Books
=====
* [Anything You Want - Derek Sivers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11878168-anything-you-want)

Articles
========
* [Masters of Love - Emily Esfahani Smith](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/happily-ever-after/372573/)
