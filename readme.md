> "The joy the Stoics were interested in can best be described as a kind of objectless enjoyment—an enjoyment not of any particular thing but of all this. It is a delight in simply being able to participate in life. It is a profound realization that even though all this didn’t have to be possible, it is possible—wonderfully, magnificently possible."

Articles
========
##### 4.
- [ ] [The frightening thing you learn when you quit the 9 to 5 - David Cain](http://www.raptitude.com/2014/04/quitting-the-9-to-5/)

> "I’m convinced now that nobody gets away with settling on work they don’t care about. The nagging banality of having to do irrelevant work five-sevenths of your days is not something that will eventually leave you alone. Nobody ever makes peace with with the ringing of their alarm clock. We either make a calculated escape, or resign to becoming cynical, bored — and worst — dependent on constant entertainment for relief, because our work does little but drain us."

##### 5.
- [ ] [Masters of love - Emily Esfahani Smith](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/happily-ever-after/372573/)

> "Throughout the day, partners would make requests for connection, what Gottman calls “bids.” For example, say that the husband is a bird enthusiast and notices a goldfinch fly across the yard. He might say to his wife, “Look at that beautiful bird outside!” He’s not just commenting on the bird here: he’s requesting a response from his wife—a sign of interest or support—hoping they’ll connect, however momentarily, over the bird."

> "The wife now has a choice. She can respond by either “turning toward” or “turning away” from her husband, as Gottman puts it. Though the bird-bid might seem minor and silly, it can actually reveal a lot about the health of the relationship. The husband thought the bird was important enough to bring it up in conversation and the question is whether his wife recognizes and respects that."

##### 6.
- [ ] [The Secret to Connecting With People - David Cain](http://www.raptitude.com/2009/04/the-secret-to-connecting-with-people/)

> "The habit of really listening to what someone is saying is a rare one.  And the people who do it can connect with anyone.  I’ve understood the value of being a good listener for a long time, but I didn’t really know what it meant to be one.  I know now: it means to cherish other people’s desire to express themselves more than your own desire to express yourself. Really, just completely defer your interests for as long as it takes for you to understand them."

##### 7.
- [ ] [The Cook and the Chef: Musk’s Secret Sauce - Tim Urban](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html)

> "The challenge with this last epiphany is to somehow figure out a way to lose respect for your own fear. That respect is in our wiring, and the only way to weaken it is by defying it and seeing, when nothing bad ends up happening, that most of the fear you’ve been feeling has just been a smoke and mirrors act. Doing something out of your comfort zone and having it turn out okay is an incredibly powerful experience, one that changes you—and each time you have that kind of experience, it chips away at your respect for your brain’s ingrained, irrational fears."

Other
=====

##### 8.
- [ ] [Ira Glass on Storytelling - animated typography by David Shiyang Liu](https://vimeo.com/24715531)

> "Everybody who does interesting, creative work, went through a phase where they had really good taste but they could tell what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be."

##### 9.
- [ ] [The Man in the Arena - Theodore Roosevelt - illustrated by Gavin Aung Than](http://zenpencils.com/comic/theodore-roosevelt-the-man-in-the-arena/)

> "... if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."

##### 10.
- [x] [The Summer Day - Mary Oliver](http://www.loc.gov/poetry/180/133.html)

> "Tell me, what is it you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life?"

Why?
====

> "As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives." - Henry David Thoreau

I feel like a lot of people read important ideas once and never get the chance to implement them. The purpose of this list is that ideas that are important to me get the chance to take hold in my mind. By reading these works annually, I will be introduced to these ideas again and again until they become habitual to me.
